## EV Charging Model

This repository contains the code and models developed as part of my MPhil research in Engineering and Computer Science, focused on electric vehicle (EV) charging optimisation in residential apartment buildings.

The project investigates how different charging infrastructure configurations and coordination strategies affect economic cost, grid performance, and user outcomes. It includes both uncoordinated (baseline) and coordinated (optimised) charging models, with a particular emphasis on socio-techno-economic trade-offs such as investment cost, peak reduction, load variability, and fairness across EV users.

The repository serves as a research and experimentation framework supporting simulation, optimisation, and result analysis used in my thesis work.
